## 13 - Programming Basics with Python

Python one of my favorite programming languages.
It is easy to learn and has a lot of libraries. It is a great language to start with.
For me is Python one of the most versatile programming languages.
You can create a lot of things with Python for example:

- Web applications
- Web scraping
- Automation
- Machine learning
- Data science
- AI

### Python basics

#### Variables types

- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
- Lists
- Sets
- Dictionary
- And a lot more but they are not used in the course

#### Variables are objects?

A variable is a reference to an object. The variable is not the object.
The variable is a pointer to the object.
This means it can have multiple functions and methods.
You can check what type of variable it is with the type() function.
A python variable is overwrite. For example Golang is not overwriteable.

These are some methods and functions that you can use on variables:

- str() - cast to string
- int() - cast to int
- set() - cast to set
- f"{}" - format string
- .isdigit() - check if string is digit 
- .split() - split string
- .append(<el>) - add element to list
- .add(<el>) - add element to set
- .remove(<el>) - remove element from set
